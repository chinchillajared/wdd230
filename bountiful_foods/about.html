            <h2>Our History:</h2>
            <p>Bountiful Foods was founded in 1990 by John Smith, a passionate organic farmer 
                in Carlsbad, California. From a small farm, we grew into a hub for organic and 
                locally sourced fruits and vegetables.</p>
                <p>1995: Opened our first storefront in downtown Carlsbad, gaining popularity for 
                quality produce and a genuine connection with customers.</p> 
                <p>2005: Introduced food trucks, reaching a broader audience along the Southern 
                California coast, from Los Angeles to San Diego.</p>
                <p>Today, we remain dedicated to our roots, nourishing the community with fresh, 
                healthy produce and delightful fruit drinks.</p>
